## Whats This?
This is a (WIP)job-board(not technically). Its a template that consumes [remoteok.com](remoteok.com) API(if you have been my follower for sometime you know I love APIs).

Since the remoteok.com API is free, I also fetched a free HTML template and put together a Nodejs/ejs project that helps you find remote jobs.

## Why FREE
I have build almost all my project using FREE APIs. From the ones that pay the lowest to my highest paying projects. Most of my projects start as simple as this one, then I  find ways to monetize.

## Can I use it?
Feel FREE! No guarantees that this project will work or will make you money or will be safe! All efforts are made to ensure its usable.

## Whats in the future
I am working to make this a better site for everyone, so in future, am going to add the following:
- [x] Basic Site
- [x] RemoteOk.com API
- [ ] SEO Implemented
- [ ] Track link clicks
- [ ] Dashboard for admin
- [ ] Allow job posting (Hybrid Jobs - From remoteok.com and locally posted)
- [ ] Implement billing
- [ ] Any other(Soon to see with the project projection)
